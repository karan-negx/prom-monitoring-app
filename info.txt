docker-compose up --build

Python app: http://localhost:8000

Metrics: http://localhost:8000/metrics

Prometheus UI: http://localhost:9090

In prometheus.yml, the target app:8000 refers to the Docker service name (app) defined in the docker-compose.yml file, like this:

Docker Compose creates a network where services can talk to each other using their service names as hostnames.

So:

    app:8000 = service app running on port 8000

    Prometheus can resolve app to the correct container IP address internally

f you wrote localhost:8000, Prometheus (which is in its own container) would look for port 8000 inside its own container, not the app's.

Only app:8000 works inside the Docker network created by Compose.
